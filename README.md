# Portfolio Project (Checkpoint)

This is my **portfolio web page** created as part of the checkpoint exercise.  
It is a simple practice project — not a professional website — and its purpose is to demonstrate my understanding of basic HTML and CSS.

### Sections

- **Home**
- **About**
- **Work**
- **Resume**
- **Contact**

### Features

- Semantic HTML structure
- Navbar with multiple sections
- Styled with CSS (colors, fonts, layout)
- Forms for the Contact section
- Embedded video ("Coming Soon") to represent future projects
- Footer for navigation and extra info

### Notes

- This project is only for the **checkpoint evaluation**.
- The layout and content are kept simple by design.
